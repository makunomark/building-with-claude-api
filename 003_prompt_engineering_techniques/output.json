Protein intake is appropriately calibrated for muscle-building goals. The meal structure is practical and compact without verbose preparation instructions. The primary concern is the meal count (6 meals plus optional) slightly exceeds the 4-5 meal guideline, though the optional nature of the before-bed meal provides flexibility. Minor mathematical inconsistencies in percentage calculations don't affect the practical utility of the plan. Overall, this is a well-constructed, athlete-appropriate meal plan that meets all stated criteria."

It also meets both secondary criteria regarding caloric target and hydration strategy. However, it violates the practical implementation criterion by including 7 eating occasions instead of the specified maximum of 6. The incomplete hydration section is a minor presentation issue but doesn't invalidate the core content. The optional evening snack, while labeled optional, still counts toward the meal occasion count and creates structural ambiguity."

However, it fails a MANDATORY requirement by not providing a complete daily caloric total and final macronutrient breakdown. The incomplete dinner section is a critical flaw that prevents full evaluation of whether all meals are covered. While 4 of 5 meals are well-executed with detailed nutritional information, the missing dinner and absent daily totals represent incomplete delivery of the core requirements. The solution is approximately 85% complete but the missing components are essential to the task."
