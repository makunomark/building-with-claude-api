    "reasoning": "The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements: it includes daily caloric total (3,200), complete macronutrient breakdown (carbs/protein/fat with percentages), and meals with exact foods, portions, and timing. Against secondary criteria: it exceeds the 3000+ calorie target; carbohydrate loading is present but the 58% carb ratio is marginally below the ideal 55-65% range (though still acceptable for endurance); hydration timing is well-integrated with training/recovery phases; and it uses exactly 6 eating occasions. The meal plan is practical, specific, and well-structured. The macro imbalance (elevated protein at 21% vs. optimal 15-18% for endurance athletes) is a minor issue that slightly reduces the carbohydrate emphasis, but does not violate stated criteria."

Protein intake is appropriately calibrated for a muscle-building athlete. However, it violates the secondary criterion of 4-5 meals by including 6 meals, and the meal distribution is somewhat unbalanced with an unusually small dinner. The minor numerical discrepancies between stated targets and actual totals are negligible. Despite the meal count violation, the solution remains highly functional and practical for the stated goal."
