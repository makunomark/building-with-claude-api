Protein intake is appropriately calibrated for muscle-building goals. The pre- and post-workout meal timing is well-considered for a weightlifter. The primary weakness is the inclusion of 6 meals (with an optional 7th) when 4-5 were requested, though this is a minor structural issue since the optional meal is clearly marked. The solution is practical, compact, and actionable. All secondary criteria are substantially met."

All four secondary criteria are met: comprehensive meal coverage, appropriate caloric intake for a 78kg athlete, carbohydrate-rich foods throughout, and a pre-game meal timed 3-4 hours before match. However, there are two notable issues: (1) the pre-match snack includes almond butter which contradicts the plan's own guidance about avoiding high-fat foods before competition, and (2) the caloric target is slightly conservative for professional match-day preparation. The incomplete final sentence is a minor presentation flaw. Despite these issues, the solution is well-structured, practical, and meets all stated requirements."
