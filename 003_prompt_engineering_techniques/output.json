    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with precise daily totals, complete macro breakdowns, and detailed meals with portions and timing. Protein intake appropriately exceeds the 1.6-2.2g/kg standard. However, it violates the secondary criterion of 4-5 meals by including 6 meals. Additionally, while the caloric surplus approach is sound for muscle building, 3,800 calories may be excessive for an 85kg athlete and could lead to unnecessary fat gain. The meal plan is practical and compact as required. Despite these issues, the solution fundamentally delivers what was requested with good nutritional science backing."

However, it fails to meet two of the three secondary criteria: carbohydrate distribution falls short at 51% versus the required 55-65% range, and the meal plan includes 7 distinct eating occasions rather than the specified maximum of 6. While the hydration strategy is excellent and comprehensive, the carb percentage shortfall and meal frequency violation represent meaningful deviations from the stated requirements."

The plan covers breakfast through dinner with strategic snacks. All secondary criteria are met - carbohydrate-rich foods are prominent throughout, energy is sustained, and the pre-game meal is appropriately timed and light. The only notable deficiency is the incomplete summary table at the end, which appears to be a formatting/truncation error rather than a substantive content issue. The hydration plan is a valuable addition beyond requirements. The solution is well-structured, practical, and directly addresses the professional soccer player's match-day needs."
