Protein intake is appropriately calibrated for muscle-building goals. The meal structure is practical and compact without verbose preparation instructions. The primary concern is the meal count (6 meals plus optional) slightly exceeds the 4-5 meal guideline, though the optional nature of the before-bed meal provides flexibility. Minor mathematical inconsistencies in percentage calculations don't affect the practical utility of the plan.

## HYDRATION STRATEGY

It also meets both secondary criteria regarding caloric target and hydration strategy. However, it violates the practical implementation criterion by including 7 eating occasions instead of the specified maximum of 6.

                <td class="reasoning">The solution demonstrates strong structural understanding of match-day nutrition with excellent meal timing, portion specificity, and pre-game meal design. However, it fails a MANDATORY requirement by not providing a complete daily caloric total and final macronutrient breakdown. The incomplete dinner section is a critical flaw that prevents full evaluation of whether all meals are covered. While 4 of 5 meals are well-executed with detailed nutritional information, the missing dinner and absent daily totals represent incomplete delivery of the core requirements.
