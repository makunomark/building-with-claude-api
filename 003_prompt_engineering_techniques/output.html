## **Key Features for Your Goals:**
✅ **High protein** for muscle repair and growth  
✅ **Adequate carbs** for training energy and recovery  
✅ **Caloric surplus** (~300-500 above maintenance) for strength gains  
✅ **Balanced micronutrients** from whole foods  
✅ **Timing:** Carbs/protein around training sessions

**💡 Pro Tip:** Adjust portion sizes based on actual training intensity and recovery. Track progress weekly and increase calories by 100-150 if strength gains plateau.</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with precise daily totals, complete macro breakdowns, and detailed meals with portions and timing. Protein intake appropriately exceeds the 1.6-2.2g/kg standard. However, it violates the secondary criterion of 4-5 meals by including 6 meals. Additionally, while the caloric surplus approach is sound for muscle building, 3,800 calories may be excessive for an 85kg athlete and could lead to unnecessary fat gain. The meal plan is practical and compact as required. Despite these issues, the solution fundamentally delivers what was requested with good nutritional science backing.</td>

## **Key Nutrition Strategies**

✅ **Carb-loading:** 410g = 6g per kg body weight (optimal for endurance)  
✅ **Timing:** Large carbs at breakfast + lunch for sustained energy  
✅ **Electrolytes:** Sports drinks during/after long run to maintain sodium balance  
✅ **Protein distribution:** Spread across meals (20-45g per meal) for muscle recovery  
✅ **Hydration:** 500-750ml per hour during intense training  
✅ **Recovery window:** High-carb + protein meal within 30-60 min post-run  

**Pro tip:** Adjust portions based on actual run intensity—add 200-300 calories on double-training days.</pre></td>

While the hydration strategy is excellent and comprehensive, the carb percentage shortfall and meal frequency violation represent meaningful deviations from the stated requirements.</td>

All secondary criteria are met - carbohydrate-rich foods are prominent throughout, energy is sustained, and the pre-game meal is appropriately timed and light. The only notable deficiency is the incomplete summary table at the end, which appears to be a formatting/truncation error rather than a substantive content issue. The hydration plan is a valuable addition beyond requirements. The solution is well-structured, practical, and directly addresses the professional soccer player's match-day needs.</td>
