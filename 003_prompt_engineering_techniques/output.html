## Key Notes for Marathon Training:
✓ Carb-loading before long runs (80-90g carbs 1.5-2 hrs prior)  
✓ Recovery nutrition within 30 minutes post-run  
✓ Sodium intake during hydration for electrolyte balance  
✓ Adequate protein (2.5g per kg) for muscle repair  
✓ Budget estimate: $18-22 USD/day (bulk grains & affordable proteins)</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements: it includes daily caloric total (3,200), complete macronutrient breakdown (carbs/protein/fat with percentages), and meals with exact foods, portions, and timing. Against secondary criteria: it exceeds the 3000+ calorie target; carbohydrate loading is present but the 58% carb ratio is marginally below the ideal 55-65% range (though still acceptable for endurance); hydration timing is well-integrated with training/recovery phases; and it uses exactly 6 eating occasions. The meal plan is practical, specific, and well-structured. The macro imbalance (elevated protein at 21% vs. optimal 15-18% for endurance athletes) is a minor issue that slightly reduces the carbohydrate emphasis, but does not violate stated criteria.</td>

## Notes for Success
✓ **Hydration:** Drink 3-4 liters of water daily  
✓ **Timing:** Eat within 30-60 min after weightlifting  
✓ **Budget:** Estimated ~$12-15 USD per day  
✓ **Adjustments:** Add 300 kcal if strength gains plateau after 4 weeks</pre></td>

The minor numerical discrepancies between stated targets and actual totals are negligible.
