## Notes for Success:
✓ Drink 3-4 liters of water daily  
✓ Time carbs around workouts for optimal energy and recovery  
✓ Adjust portions based on training intensity and body response  
✓ Budget-friendly: eggs, chicken, rice, oats, bananas, and ground beef  
✓ Consume post-workout meal within 60 minutes to maximize muscle recovery  
✓ Monitor weight weekly and adjust calories by ±200 if needed</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution comprehensively addresses all mandatory requirements with clear daily totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and specific meals with exact portions and timing. Protein intake is appropriately calibrated for muscle-building goals. The pre- and post-workout meal timing is well-considered for a weightlifter. The primary weakness is the inclusion of 6 meals (with an optional 7th) when 4-5 were requested, though this is a minor structural issue since the optional meal is clearly marked. The solution is practical, compact, and actionable. All secondary criteria are substantially met.</td>

## Notes for Match Day Success:
✓ Prioritize easily digestible carbs to maximize glycogen stores  
✓ Stay hydrated: aim for 3-4 liters of water + electrolyte beverages  
✓ Avoid high fiber/fat meals 3-4 hours before match to prevent GI distress  
✓ Time carbs strategically around match (pre-match fueling + during-match drinks)  
✓ Post-match recovery meal crucial for glycogen replenishment and muscle repair  
✓ Budget-friendly options:</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution fully satisfies all three mandatory requirements: it includes daily caloric total (3,100), complete macronutrient breakdown (155g protein, 465g carbs, 85g fat), and meals with exact foods, portions, and timing from breakfast through dinner with pre-game consideration. All four secondary criteria are met: comprehensive meal coverage, appropriate caloric intake for a 78kg athlete, carbohydrate-rich foods throughout, and a pre-game meal timed 3-4 hours before match. However, there are two notable issues: (1) the pre-match snack includes almond butter which contradicts the plan's own guidance about avoiding high-fat foods before competition, and (2) the caloric target is slightly conservative for professional match-day preparation. The incomplete final sentence is a minor presentation flaw. Despite these issues, the solution is well-structured, practical, and meets all stated requirements.</td>
